Hookup the following:

9,8,7,6,5,4,3 = keypad (left to right)

10 = speaker pin

11 = door pin

Use a transistor and a 47 ohm resistor for the speaker off of the 12 volt power

Use a power level N-channel mosfet for the door.

Big tip, be mindful of your 12 v power supplies... The arduino mini pro (5v atmega328 16MHz used here) likes to reset when the input voltage isn't clean... Wasted at least 2 hours trying to troubleshoot that problem.

Be sure to change the adminPin at the top of the source file. This is the pin that you can use to change the normal user pin.
