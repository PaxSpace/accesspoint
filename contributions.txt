In order to contribute to this project,

It is encouraged for members of PaxSpace to request access to this project
directly instead of "Forking and submitting pull requests"

The public will follow Githubs fork/pull contribution methods

There will always be two active branches, master and develop.
All new code (except potential hot fixes and potential RC )
shall be branched from develop. The develop branch shall never be in a 
complete state of not working, no pieces of code that are still being 
troubleshooted should be merged into develop.
